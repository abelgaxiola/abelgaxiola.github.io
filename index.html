                I love my family, the beach, and technology.  Once a year I join other family members in a 60 mile bicycle ride that
                starts and ends in a family reunion in Mexico (you can find out more about it <a class="link" href="http://gaxiola.info/reunions.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
                I was born in Los Angeles and lived most of my early life in Mexico but now live in Tucson Arizona where almost all of
                my brothers and sisters currently live.  I like to stay physically active and like watching a good movie once in a while.
                Life has been good to me and I’m blessed with a beautiful wife that complements me and keeps me honest.  You can see some
                of my family pictures <a class="link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/abelgaxiola/sets/" target="_blank">here.</a>

                Social media is the big thing nowadays and even though I’m not very active in the social media scene I do have a presence
                in some of the major sites such as:
                <div style="padding:15px 0">
                    <ul class="fa-ul">

                            to stay in touch with family and friends,

                            to stay up to date with what’s happening in technology,
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            to stay in touch with what’s happening in the work place,
                        </li>

                            I really don’t use but have an account, and

                            a good site to summarize and display all of the above.

                I love technology and the Internet is what’s happening.  But what would the Internet be without websites?  I currently host more
                than ten websites that I have designed and created.  I will be the first to admit that I’m not a great designer of websites but I
                can safely say that my websites are better than 90% of what’s out there.  My sites are all responsive and can be viewed and navigated
                using a smartphone, a tablet, and/or a traditional desktop computer.  If you want to see what I’m talking about just resize the browser
                you are using to view this particular site; you will see how the contents of this website adjust themself.  Some of the websites and domain
                names I own are:
                <a class="link" href="http://gaxiola.info/" target="_blank">gaxiola.info</a>,
                <a class="link" href="http://abelgaxiola.com/" target="_blank">abelgaxiola.com</a>,

                and
                <a class="link" href="http://carteldesinaloa.com/" target="_blank">carteldesinaloa.com</a>
                just to name a few.

                If you do what you like and get paid for doing it, is it really work?  I wish that was always the case but the truth of the matter is that
                this is the case most of the time; at least those periods of time when I’m writing code or doing some web development.  My current work title
                is Applications Developer and work for the IT Department of Pima County in Tucson Arizona.  I have been working as a software developer for
                the past 15 years and been working with computers since the late 80s.  For more information about my professional life click on the

                Writing and keeping a blog is a lot of work, and I do it as an exercise on thinking and writing.  For that reason I have a couple of blogs:
                one for just writing about whatever I have in mind, the other I try to focus on technology.  Writing was the hardest subject for me in college
                and I still struggle a lot.  I still remember my teacher’s advice regarding getting better at putting my thoughts in writing: she said “just
                write whatever comes to your mind, do it often until it gets easier”.  To this date I still try to follow her advice.  My blogs are
                <a class="link" href="http://abelgaxiola.com" target="_blank">Thoughts Expressed</a> and
                <a class="link" href="http://blog.abelgaxiola.com" target="_blank">Mostly Technical</a>
            </p>

                Currently I own 12 domain names and for economic and professional reasons I create my own websites and host my own domains.  I created a Limited
                Liability Corporation and named it Ten Signals LLC.  I believe that the Internet, computer technology, and the mobile revolution are only getting
                started.   My advice to anyone that’s willing to listen is: claim your future and put a stake in the ground by having a web presence.  Leasing your
                domain name is getting harder by the minute and I sincerely doubt that it is even available.  If you’re lucky enough to find the domain name you want,
                or one you like, you can host it for less than 25 cents a day.
